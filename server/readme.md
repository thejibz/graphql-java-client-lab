# MicroProfile generated Application

## Introduction

MicroProfile Starter has generated this MicroProfile application for you.

The generation of the executable jar file can be performed by issuing the following command

    mvn clean compile quarkus:build

This will create a jar file **server-runner.jar** within the _target_ maven folder. This can be started by executing the following command

    java -jar target/server-runner.jar

You can also start the project in development mode where it automatically updates code on the fly as you save your files:

    mvn clean compile quarkus:dev

Last but not least, you can build the whole application into a one statically linked executable that does not require JVM:

    mvn clean compile quarkus:native-image -Pnative

Native executable build might take a minute. Then you can execute it on a compatible architecture without JVM:

    ./target/server-runner

To launch the test page, open your browser at the following URL

    http://localhost:8080/index.html

## Note on Native image

 * You need GraalVM installed from the GraalVM web site. Using the community edition is enough. Version 19.1.1+ is required.
 * The GRAALVM_HOME environment variable configured appropriately
 * The native-image tool must be installed; this can be done by running ```gu install native-image``` from your GraalVM directory
 * To read more about Quarkus and Native image, see https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image-guide

## Specification examples

By default, there is always the creation of a JAX-RS application class to define the path on which the JAX-RS endpoints are available.

Also, a simple Hello world endpoint is created, have a look at the class **HelloController**.
